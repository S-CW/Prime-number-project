# Test Case using Pytest with Test-Driven Development

## Overview

This is a practice of my programming development skill for test case using pytest and Test-Driven Development(TDD)


## My process

### Built with

- Python
- Pytest
- List, Dictionary
- For loop
- Classes, Inheritance, and Exception


### What I learned

TTD is a very good development practice to make code simple and bug-free. The concept of TDD is to write and correct the failed tests before writing new code (before development). It is also very easy to refactor codes based on the test cases result.


### Continued development

Although I'm not familiar with the concept and having some difficulty in writing the test cases first before code, I would like to learn more about TDD and get used to the concept as it proves to be more efficient in writing codes that is bug-free.


### Useful resources

- [Test-Driven Development](https://www.guru99.com/test-driven-development.html) - This helped me in understanding TDD and its concept more.
- [Pytest using TDD](https://stackabuse.com/test-driven-development-with-pytest/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand about writing test case. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
